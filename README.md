# Project Overview
Stock analysis or prediction model using machineleraning using the impact between different out of market factors such as weather,passenger details,gold price etc and the stock prices.
# Stock analysis
Stock analysis is the evaluation of the particular trading instrument,an investment sector or the market as a whole.Stock analysts attempt to determine the future activity of an instrument,sector or market.
Stock analysis is a method for investors and traders to make buying and selling decisions.By studying and evaluating past and current data investors and traders attempt to gain an edge in the markets by making informed decisions. 
# Machine Learing In Stock Prediction
* High level of accuracy and precision is the key factor in predicting a stock market.
* Machine Learning (ML) approach that will be trained from available stocks data, gain intelligence and then uses the acquired knowledge for accurate prediction. 
# Mandated constraints
* The Problem:: Stock analysis / prediction model*
* Solution Constraints::  Stock analysis/prediction model using machine learning using the impact between different out of market factors such as weather,passenger details,gold price etc and the stock prices.
Implementation environment of the current sysytem::  Anaconda
Backend::  Tensorflow
* Off-the shelf Software:: Windows OS, Anaconda, Python IDLE
* Schedule constraints::   Approximate time to complete the product is 4 months.
* Budjet constraints::  Cost of 6GB or higher RAM, Intel core i3 or higher at nearly 2GHz processor
# Models
* A simple feedforward neural network
# Feedforward Neural Network
* A feedforward neural network is an artificial neural network wherein connections between the nodes do notform a cycle. As such, it is different from recurrent neural networks.
* The feedforward network was the first and simplest form of artificial neural network devised.In this network the information moves in only one direction forward from the input nodes through the input nodes through the hidden nodes to the output nodes.There are no cycles or loops in the network.
# Accuracy Measurements
* The pipeline is implemented is using backtrader to implement backtesting inorder to test each individual strategy.In the future it is worthwhile to try using agenetic algorith to better figure the accuracy of the problem.
# Backtrader
  Backtrader allows you too focus on writing reusable trading strategies indicators and analyzers instead of having to spend time to       building infrastructure.
   # Features of Backtrader
        * Multiple data feeds and multiple strategies supported
          ->From CSV based files, Pandas DataFrames, blaze iterators and including connectivity to Interactive Brokers, 
                  Visual Chart and Oanda
        * Multiple Data Streams & TimeFrames
          ->The system manages several data feeds simultaneously even if they have different timeframes
        * Plotting
          ->Add matplotlib and plotting is already built-in with a single command.
        * Multiple Strategies
          ->Run multiple strategies simultaneously to balance the portfolio with different algorithms
        * Broker Simulation
          ->Including Market, Limit, Stop, StopLimit orders, volume filling strategies, slippage definitions, user extensible 
            commission schemes, futures cash adjustment, long/short selling
        * Event and Pseudo-Vectorized
          ->Run everything on a step by step basis or for added speed with tight pseudo-vectorized loop operations
        * Extensible
           ->Develop your own indicators, analyzers and observers in just a few steps
